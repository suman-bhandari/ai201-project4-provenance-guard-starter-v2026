<!-- ═══════════════════════ UNIT 7 — THE BUILD ═══════════════════════ -->

## What This Does

<!-- The path a submission takes, from arriving to the label a reader sees.
     Six or seven steps — this is the trace you wrote in Milestone 1. -->

1. Submission Ingestion: The client sends a raw text payload and an optional `creator_id` to `POST /submit`.
2. Signal 1 (Language Model Evaluation): The text is evaluated by `detector.py`, measuring predictability (perplexity) against a local language model and outputting an AI score from 0.0 to 1.0.
3. Signal 2 (Stylometric Evaluation): The text is analyzed structurally by `stylometry.py`, measuring sentence length variance, type-token ratio, and clause punctuation density, outputting an AI score from 0.0 to 1.0.
4. Signal Aggregation: `scoring.py::combine_signals` combines both scores via a weighted average and applies a disagreement dampener if the two signals conflict.
5. Threshold Categorization: `scoring.py::score_to_label` classifies the combined score into one of three ranges: human, unsure, or AI.
6. Reader-Facing Label Assignment: Plain-English text is generated to communicate the finding clearly without accusing authentic writers.
7. Audit Logging & Response: The complete decision and both signal scores are recorded to `logs/audit.jsonl`, and an actionable JSON payload with an appeal pathway is returned to the client.

## Signals and Scoring

<!-- For each signal: what property it measures, why that might differ between
     human and AI writing, and WHAT IT CAN'T SEE.

     The blind spot is not optional. If you can't name it you don't understand
     the signal yet — and unit 8's attack set is built out of blind spots. -->

### Signal one — the model signal

**What it measures:**
Text predictability, quantified as perplexity using a local causal language model.

**Why that might differ between human and AI writing:**
AI models produce text by repeatedly selecting statistically likely next tokens, resulting in uniformly low perplexity. Human writing tends to wander, featuring idiosyncratic phrasing, abrupt syntactic shifts, and domain-specific terminology that surprises the model.

**What it can't see:**
It cannot distinguish between machine generation and plain, direct human writing. Writers using simple vocabulary or short sentences—such as non-native English speakers or younger students—register as predictable and receive falsely elevated AI scores. Ornate, rare-word-heavy AI text can slip through as human.

### Signal two — the style signal

**What it measures:**
The physical shape and statistical variety of the text as raw text (sentence length variance, vocabulary repetition, and clause punctuation).

**Why that might differ between human and AI writing:**
AI models drift toward uniform sentence lengths and consistent vocabulary frequencies. Human writing is structural "lumpier," placing three-word sentences next to forty-word compound sentences.

**What it can't see:**
It cannot comprehend meaning or context. Purely cosmetic edits that alter layout without changing substance—such as splitting sentences with arbitrary full stops, injecting typos, or inserting block quotes—completely distort its measurements.

### The combining rule

<!-- Write the rule in words, then give the numbers. What happens when the two
     signals disagree? -->

**The rule:**
A weighted combination applying `config.WEIGHT_MODEL_SIGNAL` (0.65) to the language model output and `config.WEIGHT_STYLE_SIGNAL` (0.35) to the stylometry output. If the absolute difference between the two signals exceeds 0.40, the system treats the disagreement as structural uncertainty and averages the result with 0.50, pulling the composite score toward the "unsure" band.

**The numbers:**
- `WEIGHT_MODEL_SIGNAL`: 0.65
- `WEIGHT_STYLE_SIGNAL`: 0.35
- Disagreement threshold: `abs(model_score - style_score) > 0.40` pulls to `0.50`

**Where it lives:** `scoring.py::combine_signals`

<!-- ⚠️ The grader checks your code against that line. If your rule lives
     somewhere else, say where. -->

**A case where my two signals split, and what my rule does with it:**
A writer using concise, plain vocabulary produces predictable phrasing that causes `model_score` to spike to 0.78, but their natural rhythm and irregular sentence structure yields a human-like `style_score` of 0.28. The spread is 0.50 (greater than the 0.40 threshold), which dampens the weighted base score (~0.605) down to ~0.553, keeping the text inside the "unsure" tier and preventing an outright false accusation.


---

## Label Variants

<!-- The exact text of all three labels, as a reader would see them, and the
     score range each covers.

     Write them for someone who has never heard the word "threshold". -->

| Label | Score range | The exact text a reader sees |
|---|---|---|
| high-confidence human | 0.00 – 0.35 | We think this was written by a person. |
| unsure | 0.35 – 0.65 | We can't tell for sure who wrote this — it shares characteristics of both human and automated writing. |
| high-confidence AI | 0.65 – 1.00 | This text closely follows statistical patterns typical of automated writing. |

**Why I worded the "unsure" one this way:**
<!-- It's the hardest of the three. It has to admit uncertainty without
     sounding like an accusation, because the person reading it may well have
     written every word themselves. -->

The "unsure" label must admit system limitations without implying guilt. Accusing a genuine writer of dishonesty causes harm, but treating simple or non-native phrasing as inherently artificial is equally unfair. Framing the label neutrally ("it shares characteristics of both") informs readers while avoiding an accusatory tone toward human writers.

## Sample Run

<!-- One submission and one appeal, pasted as text: the request, the response,
     and the log entries. -->

**A submission**

<!-- The response needs content_id, guess, confidence, label, AND both
     signal scores - model_score and style_score. Unit 8's tools read those
     two off the response, so leaving them out costs you next unit's
     diagnostics. -->

```bash
$ curl -X POST http://127.0.0.1:5000/submit \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "text": "The implementation of the proposed framework requires careful consideration of several key factors. First, it is important to note that the system must be able to handle a wide variety of different inputs. Additionally, the overall performance of the solution depends on a number of important variables.",
    "creator_id": "suman"
  }'
  ```

```json
{
  "confidence": 0.6206,
  "content_id": "c_39583a80584f",
  "creator_id": "suman",
  "guess": "unsure",
  "label": "We can't tell for sure who wrote this — it shares characteristics of both human and automated writing.",
  "model_score": 0.8864,
  "style_score": 0.4714
}

```

**An appeal**

```bash
$ curl -X POST http://127.0.0.1:5000/appeal \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "content_id": "c_39583a80584f",
    "creator_id": "suman",
    "reasoning": "This is my personal reflective essay about my work routine; the plain phrasing is deliberate."
  }'
```

```json
{
  "content_id": "c_39583a80584f",
  "message": "Appeal recorded and queued for review.",
  "ok": true,
  "status": "under_review"

```

**What the log shows afterwards**

```bash
$ curl "http://127.0.0.1:5000/log?limit=3"
```

```json
{
  "count": 2,
  "entries": [
    {
      "combined_score": 0.6206,

      "style_score": 0.4714,
      "timestamp": "2026-11-01T11:29:59+00:00"
    },
    {
      "content_id": "c_39583a80584f",
      "creator_id": "suman",
      "event": "appeal",

      "status": "under_review",
      "timestamp": "2026-11-01T12:51:38+00:00"
    }
  ]
}

## Rate Limiting

**My limits:** ___ per minute, ___ per day

**Why those numbers and not others:**
<!-- Think about two people: a real writer submitting their own work a few
     times an hour, and a script sending a thousand variations to map your
     thresholds. Your numbers have to be liveable for the first and hostile to
     the second. -->

**What a caller counts as:** <!-- per address, or per creator_id? They fail
differently — one script can look like a thousand callers, and one household
can look like one. -->

**The run of status codes when I pushed past it:**

<!-- python run_attacks.py --flood 15 -->

```

```

---

## Attack Run — Before

<!-- Every attack with its outcome and a held-or-broke mark.
     `run_attacks.py --label before` produces the table. -->



**Ten audit log entries from the run**

<!-- Choose entries that show the interesting failures, not the ten easiest. -->

```json

```

**The single worst outcome** — the one I'd least want to explain to a writer
whose work got caught by it:



---

## Run Log and Verdicts

<!-- Your five criteria across three trials. `run_eval.py --label before`. -->

| Criterion | Target | Run 1 | Run 2 | Run 3 | Verdict |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1.  |  |  |  |  |  |
| 2.  |  |  |  |  |  |
| 3.  |  |  |  |  |  |
| 4.  |  |  |  |  |  |
| 5.  |  |  |  |  |  |

**Real output from one trial**, pasted as text, naming the file and function
that produced it:

```json

```

**Diagnoses**

<!-- For each miss AND each broken attack: the stage and the mechanism.

     Your service has five stages: the route, signal one, signal two, the
     combining rule, and the label mapping.

     Not a diagnosis:  "The evasion attacks got through."
     A diagnosis:      "Four evasion inputs got through. All four had typos
                        added to AI-generated text. My second signal measures
                        word variety, and typos raise word variety — so it read
                        them as more human. My combining rule weights that
                        signal at 0.6, so it dragged the whole score down."

     Look for a pattern. Five failures on one signal is one problem, not five. -->



---

## The Improvement

**What I changed:**

**Which diagnosis pointed at it:**

### Attack Run — After

<!-- Same format. `run_attacks.py --label after` -->



**Did it help, and how do I know:**

<!-- Widening the unsure band usually fixes one problem and creates another.
     Reporting that trade honestly is worth full credit. -->



---

## What's Still Broken

<!-- For each attack still getting through and each criterion still missed:
     what you'd do, and why you stopped. -->



**The trade I'd make if this ran for real:**

<!-- Two sentences. Fewer wrong accusations means more AI text getting through.
     Say which way you'd go and WHO PAYS FOR IT. -->
